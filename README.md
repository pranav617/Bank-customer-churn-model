Project Overview
The project focuses on predicting customer churn in a banking institution using machine learning techniques. The goal is to identify customers who are likely to leave the bank so that proactive measures can be taken to retain them.

Information
Dataset

Source: The dataset can be sourced from online repositories like Kaggle or can be provided by the banking institution.
Size: Typically, the dataset consists of several thousand customer records with multiple features.
Features: Common features include CustomerID, Gender, Age, Tenure, Balance, Number of Products, Has Credit Card, Is Active Member, Estimated Salary, and the target variable, Exited (indicating if the customer left the bank).
Data Preprocessing

Data Cleaning: Handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistent data.
Feature Engineering: Create new features if necessary, encode categorical variables, normalize/standardize numerical features.
Data Splitting: Split the data into training and testing sets (e.g., 80% training, 20% testing).
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Visualization: Use histograms, box plots, and pair plots to understand the distribution and relationships of features.
Correlation Analysis: Identify correlations between features and the target variable.
Model Selection and Training

Algorithms: Explore multiple algorithms like Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM), and XGBoost.
Training Process: Train each model using the training data.
Hyperparameter Tuning: Use techniques like Grid Search or Random Search to optimize model parameters.
Model Evaluation

Metrics: Evaluate models using metrics such as Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, and ROC-AUC.
Confusion Matrix: Analyze the confusion matrix to understand the performance in terms of true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives.
Results and Discussion

Best Model: Identify the best-performing model based on evaluation metrics.
Feature Importance: Determine which features have the most significant impact on the prediction.
Insights: Draw actionable insights that can help in devising customer retention strategies.
Limitations: Discuss any limitations of the current approach and potential improvements.
Conclusion

Summarize the findings and effectiveness of the model.
Highlight the impact of the model on business decisions related to customer retention.
Future Work

Suggest further enhancements such as incorporating more diverse data, using advanced machine learning techniques like deep learning, and exploring additional features like customer feedback.
